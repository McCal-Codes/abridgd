## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-18

### Added - iOS 26 UI System
- **iOS 26-inspired UI component system** with glass morphism effects:
  - **GlassButton**: Blur-effect buttons with prominence styles (standard, tinted, filled, destructive)
  - **NavigationHeader**: Custom header with subtitle support (SwiftUI `.navigationSubtitle()` equivalent)
  - **BottomToolbar**: Glass toolbar with semantic item placement, fixed/flexible spacers

  - **BlurSheet**: Bottom sheet with dynamic blur/transparency based on detent position
- **ThemeContext**: Centralized theme management with automatic light/dark mode switching
- **iOS26DemoScreen**: Interactive showcase of all new components (accessible from Debug settings)

### Added - User Features
- **Swipe Gestures** in ArticleScreen:
  - Swipe right from left edge to go back
  - Swipe left to save/unsave articles
  - Haptic feedback on successful actions
- **Dark Mode**: Automatic theme switching based on system appearance
- **RSVP Reader**: Abridged Mode for high-speed reading (formerly marked "coming soon")

### Enhanced

  - Increased blur intensity (50 → 60)

### Technical
- Added dependencies: `expo-blur@~15.0.8`, `react-native-gesture-handler@~2.28.0`
- All animations use react-native-reanimated spring physics (damping: 20, stiffness: 300)
- Haptic feedback integration via expo-haptics for button presses and gesture completions
- Platform-aware blur effects (iOS native blur, Android solid backgrounds)
- Safe area handling throughout all components
- Modern Gesture.Pan() API for gesture handling (replaced deprecated useAnimatedGestureHandler)
- Colorblind-friendly cyan accent colors (#0097A7 light, #00BCD4 dark)
